## :rocket: About the project

This project is a basic clone of Facebook, replicating many of the features found on the home, profile, and friends pages. It includes interactive elements such as portals and poppers to enhance user interaction.

The interface closely matches the original design, is fully responsive, and supports dark mode. Components are organized using the Atomic Design methodology.

Currently, there's no authentication system, so users are represented by dummy/random data, allowing anyone to log in with just a click. The data for users, chats, photos, posts, comments, reactions, and friendships is generated using a script (not included in this repository) that utilizes Faker and LoremFlickr.

Data is stored in Firebase and optimized to reduce document reads by consolidating essential information into single documents. Since the focus is not on scaling to a large number of users, this approach prioritizes simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, user data is indexed using Algolia to provide fast and efficient search autocomplete.

## :wrench: Getting Started

### Forking and Setting Up

If you want to fork and run this project locally, you'll need to set up a few things:

1. **Firebase and Algolia Access**: The project requires Firebase and Algolia credentials. Create your own accounts and services or contact me for access to existing ones.

2. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APP_ID=your_algolia_app_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_algolia_search_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_URL=your_firebase_database_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MESSENGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
   ```

3. **Database Data**: The application requires a specific data structure to function properly:

   - The original data was generated using a 500-line script (unfortunately lost) with Faker and LoremFlickr
   - If you need a copy of the database structure and sample data, please email me at zivavu@gmail.com
   - Alternatively, you can create your own data following the Firebase structure visible in the code

4. **Installation and Running**:

   ```bash
   # Install dependencies using your preferred package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun)
   npm install
   # or
   bun install

   # Run development server
   npm run dev
   # or
   bun dev

   # Run tests
   npm run test:e2e
   # or
   bun test:e2e
   ```
